# Deformable Mirror Calibration

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a streamlined process for calibration of

a deformable mirror. Specifically, making use of a phase diversity method and a

algorithm based on the assumption of Poisson-distributed noise, the wavefront

aberrations introduced by a given actuator as a function of applied actuatation

parameter can be determined from a set of calibration images captured with

differing degrees of defocus.
